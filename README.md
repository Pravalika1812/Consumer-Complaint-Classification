# Consumer-Complaint-Classification

In this project, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to automate
the classification of consumer complaints in the
financial sector. We applied several machine
learning models—Multinomial Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost,
XGBoost, and KNN—along with the advanced
NLP model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), aiming to improve the efficiency of complaint resolution processes. Using data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we performed extensive
preprocessing to prepare for effective model
training. Each model was evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-
score. XGBoost showed the best overall performance, while BERT excelled in handling complex textual content, and KNN demonstrated
high precision but faced challenges in model
generalization. This project highlights the utility of NLP and machine learning in streamlining complaint management in the financial
sector, which could lead to quicker resolutions
and enhanced customer satisfaction.
