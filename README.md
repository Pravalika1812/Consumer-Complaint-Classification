# Consumer-Complaint-Classification

In this project, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to automate
the classification of consumer complaints in the
financial sector. We applied several machine
learning models—Multinomial Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost,
XGBoost, and KNN—along with the advanced
NLP model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), aiming to improve the efficiency of complaint resolution processes. Using data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we performed extensive
preprocessing to prepare for effective model
training. Each model was evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-
score. XGBoost showed the best overall performance, while BERT excelled in handling complex textual content, and KNN demonstrated
high precision but faced challenges in model
generalization. This project highlights the utility of NLP and machine learning in streamlining complaint management in the financial
sector, which could lead to quicker resolutions
and enhanced customer satisfaction.
